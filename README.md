I was invited to speak at Google Cloud Next Sanfrancisco 2019 and [Google Cloud Next UK 2019](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/uk/speakers?session=DZ220)
## **Know Yourself, Know Your Enemy**: Detecting Anomalous Behavior Using Machine Learning: 

The sheer volume of logs in corporate environments unveils an opportunity to apply Machine learning. By understanding and modeling the normal state of a digital ecosystem and its elements, you can spot anomalous behavior that can potentially be a threat. In this talk, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art research on threat detection using Machine Learning, and we identify the challenges we are yet to overcome.
